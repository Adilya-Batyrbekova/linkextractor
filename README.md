This repository is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) tutorial that illustrates some basics of Docker application containerization platform.
It starts from running a very basic script and gradually leads to a multi-service container orchestration (AKA micro-service architecture).
Follow instructions in the `README` files of various folders from `step0` to `step6` and explore corresponding code.
To run illustrated codes `Docker` and `Compose` need to be installed on the machine.

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
